# Hey, thanks for coming! This is my chat app 

Main technologies or methodologies: 
 - Chatbot logic to interact with the users
 - Web Sockets for the chat between users functionality,
 - UI using some cool CodePens for the better UX


## The idea

The idea is to make interaction with a chatbot more social and let unlimited amount of peers use a chatbot and share the experience between each other.

I also did not add usernames to each message to bring some kind of anonimity to each particular message

You know who is participating in the chat, but knowing who said something particular can apply pressure on the person speaking.
